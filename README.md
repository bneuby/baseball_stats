Analytics project on large baseball dataset

# Data source: Open Source Sports 

# Data Cleansing 

In the dataset there were __ csv files. I wanted to only use the tables that I thought were interesting and would be useful.

I was able to go through each of these __ csv files and cleanse them, for important missing data values I would use the mean of that feild to fill in the missing data points. 

I also cleared out feilds that I found to be detremental to the data (too many missing data points, irrelavent information).
